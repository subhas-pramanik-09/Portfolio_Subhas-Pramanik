# 🧠 From Computer Vision Concepts to Real-Time AI Applications (CPU-only!)

Over the past few weeks, I explored **Computer Vision** using **Python** and Google’s **MediaPipe** library — running entirely on **CPU**.  
I started with **core concepts** like landmark detection, hand & face tracking, pose estimation, and real-time image processing.  
Then, I applied them to build these exciting **real-time applications**:

## 🚀 Projects Built

### 🖐 Hand Tracking & Finger Counter
Tracks hand landmarks in real-time and counts the number of raised fingers.

### 😊 Face Detection & Face Mesh
Detects faces and maps **468 facial landmarks**, useful for AR filters or expression analysis.

### 🏃 AI Personal Trainer (Pose Estimation)
Tracks body posture and counts workout reps — a basic fitness assistant.

### 🔊 Gesture-based Volume Control
Controls system volume by moving fingers closer or farther apart.

### 🖱 AI Virtual Mouse
Controls the mouse cursor and clicks using hand gestures.
